Data Structures In python

While writing any algorithm there are two things to keep in mind
    
    1. Time Complexity
    2. Space Complexity
 
Before going into further detail, lets try and understand how these
complexities are measured, what is the notation used for measuring
these metrics.

## The Big - O() Notation

big - O() notation gives you the representation of time/space
complexity of your algorithm for input of length n.
