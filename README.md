Data Structures In python

Data structures are like containers they will allow us to store several pieces of data into single structure, there are many data
structures that will provide an efficient way of Organizing, storing and accessing the data.


## Data Types
    1. Numerical Data Types
    2. Boolean Data Types
    3. String



### Numerical Data Type
    1. Int
    2. Long
    3. Short
    4. Float
    5. Double

Python3 stores all numerical data types as **Long Int**






While writing any algorithm there are two things to keep in mind
    
    1. Time Complexity
    2. Space Complexity
 
Before going into further detail, lets try and understand how these
complexities are measured, what is the notation used for measuring
these metrics.

## The Big - O() Notation

big - O() notation gives you the representation of time/space
complexity of your algorithm for input of length n.
